End of Changelog


üîÑ NREM v1.2 Changelog
Release Date: May 2025
Project Name: NREM (Network Reconnaissance & Enumeration Module)
Developer: Linux Services

‚úÖ What's New
üîß Added Features:
[Option 10] HTTP Headers Check

Uses curl -I to fetch and display response headers for any given URL.

Output saved to headers.txt.

[Option 11] Reverse DNS Lookup

Uses nslookup to resolve an IP address to its hostname.

Output saved to reverse_dns.txt.

üñºÔ∏è UI/Visual Enhancements
New color-coded ASCII banner using ANSI escape codes for clearer terminal appearance.

Menu spacing and numbering now more readable and uniform.

Added real-time clock display.

Cleaner section headers (call :header) for better navigation and reuse.

üìÅ Structural & Quality Improvements
Output files like active_ips.txt, wifi_passwords.txt, geolocate_result.txt, etc., are now cleaned/created at startup for reliability.

Introduced a logs/ directory (currently unused, but intended for future logging support).

Ensured all temporary files (e.g., temp_profiles.txt) are deleted after use.

Code modularization via call :header for header reuse.

Improved error handling for whois and external tools.

Enhanced consistency in naming output files for clarity.

üêû Known/Possible Bugs or Limitations
WHOIS command may fail if the whois utility is not installed or available in the system PATH.

Curl dependency: Both geolocation and HTTP header checks require curl, which may not be pre-installed on all Windows systems.

PowerShell Port Scan may be slow depending on the network and machine performance.

Reverse DNS lookups are dependent on DNS configurations and may not return results for all IPs.

Limited Wi-Fi retrieval: The script only pulls passwords for profiles stored locally with plaintext keys enabled.

üìå Recommendations for Future Releases
Use a GUI or TUI framework like dialog or PowerShell forms for more professional UI.

Integrate public APIs for breach checks instead of manual browser redirection.

Add an "Export All Results" feature.

Build .exe version via a batch-to-exe converter for distribution.
