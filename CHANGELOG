📝 NREM OSINT Tool – Version 1.4 Changelog
Release Date: 2025-05-05
Author: Linux Services

🔧 Improvements & Changes
Enhanced UI with better layout and character encoding (chcp 65001).

Standardized menu and module structure for easier navigation.

Log files now include timestamps for improved organization.

Replaced static output with more dynamic and interactive prompts.

Auto-delete of previous session data for cleaner operation.

Compatibility checks for required tools like curl, whois, and exiftool.

🆕 New Features Added
✅ Phone Number OSINT – Opens Truecaller to check number reputation.

✅ Wayback Machine Lookup – View archived versions of websites.

✅ Google Dork Generator – Automate dork-based queries for reconnaissance.

✅ Shodan Search – Search IPs/domains directly via Shodan.

✅ Pastebin Email Leak Search – Check if emails appear in Pastebin dumps.

✅ Username Availability Checker – Opens Namechk to check username presence.

✅ Email Breach Check – Quickly check known breaches using HIBP.

✅ Subdomain Finder – Uses CRT.sh to list subdomains.

✅ Reverse DNS & IP Lookup – NSLookup-based hostname enumeration.

✅ IP Range Scanner – Ping-sweep a /24 subnet interactively.

🛠️ Bug Fixes & Stability
Resolved crashing when invalid or empty input was given.

Improved error handling for missing commands (e.g., whois, netsh, exiftool).

Suppressed unwanted console noise from tools.

File outputs now cleanly overwrite old versions to avoid merge errors.






🛠️ NREM Project – Patch Notes v1.3.1
🔧 Fixed
Geolocation Repetition Bug:
Resolved a critical issue in the :geolocate function where the API response from ip-api.com was duplicated multiple times. The function now correctly fetches and displays a single, clean set of geolocation data for the given IP.

✅ Improved
Output Parsing:
The geolocation output is now filtered and formatted to show only relevant fields like City, Region, Country, ISP, Organization, Latitude, and Longitude.

File Cleanup:
Ensured temporary JSON and result files are properly overwritten to avoid old data being reused.

🛠 NREM v1.3 Patch Notes (May 2025)
🆕 New Features
🔍 OSINT Enhancements:
[NEW] Phone Number OSINT Tool – Launches Truecaller in browser for manual lookup.

[NEW] Wayback Machine Lookup – Check archived snapshots of any website.

[NEW] IP Range Scanner – Scan any subnet (e.g., 192.168.0.1–254) for active IPs.

[NEW] Username Availability Checker – Launches Namechk to check username availability across many platforms.

📶 Local Recon Upgrades:
[Improved] Wi-Fi Password Dumper – Now fetches all saved Wi-Fi passwords with SSID labels and outputs cleanly into wifi_passwords.txt.

🌐 Recon Tools:
Shodan Search Integration – Quickly launch IP/domain queries on Shodan.

Reverse DNS Lookup – Gets hostname for a given IP.

Reverse IP Lookup – Basic reverse DNS implementation.

Metadata Extraction – Uses exiftool to dump file metadata.

Pastebin Email Leak Search – Opens a Pastebin query for email exposure.

Google Dork Generator – Generate and test dorks via Google Search.

⚙️ Internal/UX Improvements
Fixed delayed variable expansion issues during Wi-Fi scan (no more !ssid! crash).

Cleaned up temp file handling (e.g., temp_profiles.txt, .txt logs).

Each tool now clearly tells where output is saved (like headers.txt, geolocate_result.txt, etc.).

Default console size adjusted to 100x30 for wider output compatibility.

UTF-8 encoding added (chcp 65001) for broader character support.

🐞 Known/Possible Bugs & Issues
Type	Description
❗ Critical	Crash when ssid has leading/trailing spaces or special characters. Might still cause parsing issues in wifi_passwords.txt.
❗ Critical	whois not guaranteed on all Windows setups. User may see “WHOIS command not available.”
⚠️ Moderate	If exiftool is missing, metadata feature will silently fail.
⚠️ Moderate	powershell Test-NetConnection port scan may fail on older systems or with restricted permissions.
⚠️ Moderate	curl dependency is mandatory; users on Windows 7 or older may not have it.
⚠️ Minor	Some Google searches (social media, dorks, etc.) may not return accurate results due to regional differences or CAPTCHA.
⚠️ Minor	Phone OSINT and username checker just open external sites – no API integration or data parsing yet.
🧪 Experimental	Reverse DNS and IP lookup just use nslookup, which isn't reliable for full reconnaissance.
