🛠 NREM v1.3 Patch Notes (May 2025)
🆕 New Features
🔍 OSINT Enhancements:
[NEW] Phone Number OSINT Tool – Launches Truecaller in browser for manual lookup.

[NEW] Wayback Machine Lookup – Check archived snapshots of any website.

[NEW] IP Range Scanner – Scan any subnet (e.g., 192.168.0.1–254) for active IPs.

[NEW] Username Availability Checker – Launches Namechk to check username availability across many platforms.

📶 Local Recon Upgrades:
[Improved] Wi-Fi Password Dumper – Now fetches all saved Wi-Fi passwords with SSID labels and outputs cleanly into wifi_passwords.txt.

🌐 Recon Tools:
Shodan Search Integration – Quickly launch IP/domain queries on Shodan.

Reverse DNS Lookup – Gets hostname for a given IP.

Reverse IP Lookup – Basic reverse DNS implementation.

Metadata Extraction – Uses exiftool to dump file metadata.

Pastebin Email Leak Search – Opens a Pastebin query for email exposure.

Google Dork Generator – Generate and test dorks via Google Search.

⚙️ Internal/UX Improvements
Fixed delayed variable expansion issues during Wi-Fi scan (no more !ssid! crash).

Cleaned up temp file handling (e.g., temp_profiles.txt, .txt logs).

Each tool now clearly tells where output is saved (like headers.txt, geolocate_result.txt, etc.).

Default console size adjusted to 100x30 for wider output compatibility.

UTF-8 encoding added (chcp 65001) for broader character support.

🐞 Known/Possible Bugs & Issues
Type	Description
❗ Critical	Crash when ssid has leading/trailing spaces or special characters. Might still cause parsing issues in wifi_passwords.txt.
❗ Critical	whois not guaranteed on all Windows setups. User may see “WHOIS command not available.”
⚠️ Moderate	If exiftool is missing, metadata feature will silently fail.
⚠️ Moderate	powershell Test-NetConnection port scan may fail on older systems or with restricted permissions.
⚠️ Moderate	curl dependency is mandatory; users on Windows 7 or older may not have it.
⚠️ Minor	Some Google searches (social media, dorks, etc.) may not return accurate results due to regional differences or CAPTCHA.
⚠️ Minor	Phone OSINT and username checker just open external sites – no API integration or data parsing yet.
🧪 Experimental	Reverse DNS and IP lookup just use nslookup, which isn't reliable for full reconnaissance.
